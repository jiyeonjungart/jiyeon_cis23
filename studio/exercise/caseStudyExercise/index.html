      Snack Mate is a project that showcases series of K-Dramas that Jia
      watched. Jia used to not be the biggest fan of K-Dramas. However, she
      often felt left out as many of her friends watched K-Dramas and the main
      topic of the conversation would revolve around the K-Dramas they watched.
      Therefore, she started to watch as many K-Dramas as soon as possible. The
      project presents the K-dramas that she has watched through out the years
      and how she would rank it out of 5. It also contains conversations with
      her friends that relates to each K-Dramas.
